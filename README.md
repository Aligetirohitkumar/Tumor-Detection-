# TUMOR-DETECTION-USING-PYTHON

Project Title: Tumor Detection Using Python and Jupyter Notebook

Description:
This project leverages Python with Jupyter Notebook to conduct advanced data analysis on tumor detection. The analysis utilizes a single dataset:

[Tumor_Detection.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17931063/Tumor_Detection.csv)-Contains data for identifying the occurrence of tumors.

The project focuses on analyzing the dataset to predict the accuracy of tumor occurrence. Various visualizations (PNG images) were generated as outputs, illustrating key findings and accuracy metrics from the analysis.
